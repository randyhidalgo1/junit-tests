//Create a StudentTest.java class file inside of src/test/java (you might have to
//create these folders yourself) and remember to write the test before the actual
//production code. We will simulate the C(reate) R(ead) from the CRUD functionality
//in our grades application,
//you should be able to test and create the following requirements:
//The Student class should have a constructor that sets both the
//name and id property, it initializes the grades property as an empty ArrayList.
